# This repository contains the scripts I used for the Biology 722 final project (McMaster University graduate course)

# Shell scripts were used in pre-processing RNA-seq data on the Golding lab cluster (info@mcmaster.ca)
# All shell scripts were placed directly into the directories where I wanted them to run

# The R script was used in the differential expression analysis

# Data produced during this project (eg. fastqc reports, RSeQC reports, counts) are present on my account on the Golding lab cluster, as well as on my external hard drive. Counts are also saved on my laptop.

# Thank you to everyone who helped me with this project:
# Thanks to Natassja for figuring out how to download datasets from the SRA
# A huge thank you to Garrett for providing example scripts (especially the R script) and answering a ton of my questions
# Thanks to Dr. Golding, Dr. Evans and Dr. Dworkin for the in class tutorials, answering questions, and providing feedback
# Thanks to Dr Cameron (my supervisor) for her input on the direction of the project and for editing my slides
